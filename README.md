Go to the index page and http://www.fardmuhammad.com/stuff/graffiti/wall2/ in two browser windows.<br />
Draw on the grey square in the center of the main page, and the image will show on Wall2. Like magic.<br />
Mash on that "clear" button or reload the page to start anew from both pages.<br />
"Paint" is  available in many colors... as long as it's black.<br />
